# Banking Form with Live Data Display

## Project Overview

This is a simple web page for a banking application where users fill out a form on one side of the page, and the submitted information is dynamically displayed on the other side in a table. This project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality for data collection and real-time updates.

## Features

- User-friendly banking form with fields for name, account number, bank name, and balance.
- Real-time display of form data in a table adjacent to the form.
- Dynamic interaction using vanilla JavaScript.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the form and table.
- `styles.css` - CSS file for styling the form and table layout.
- `script.js` - JavaScript file for handling form submission and dynamic table updates.

## How It Works

1. **Form Input:**
   Users fill out the form with their banking details (name, account number, bank name, balance).

2. **Data Display:**
   As the user fills the form and submits the data, the input is displayed in a table format beside the form. Each submission adds a new row to the table with the entered details.

3. **Live Data Update:**
   The data is updated in real-time without page refresh.
